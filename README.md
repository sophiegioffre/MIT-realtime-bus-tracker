# Real Time Bus Tracker
This project shows real-time movement of all of busses on route 1 in Boston, MA, with a focus on the route between MIT and Harvard. 

# DESCRIPTION 
Shows a map of Boston centered on the area around MIT and Harvard. Bus stops between MIT and Harvard are designated with red map markers. Each blue map marker refers to a different bus. Every 15s the map updates the locations of each bus, moving the blue map markers.

# HOW TO RUN
Download all files to your local drive and load the index.html file into a Google Chrome browser.

# ROAD MAP TO FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
I plan to improve this project in the following ways:
- Customize the blue map markers to an icon of a bus
- Customize the red map markers to an icon of a bus stop
- Add a hover event for each bus marker to show bus status, number, and destination
